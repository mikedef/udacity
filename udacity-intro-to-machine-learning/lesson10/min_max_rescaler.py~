""" quiz materials for feature scaling clustering """

### FYI, the most straightforward implementation might 
### throw a divide-by-zero error, if the min and max
### values are the same
### but think about this for a second--that means that every
### data point has the same value for that feature!  
### why would you rescale it?  Or even use it at all?
